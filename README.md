# A ZK extension for Angular JS

This project aims to provide a convenient way for Java developers to bind the data from server to client and vise versa.
It contains both powers of [AngularJS][angularjs] and [ZK MVVM][mvvm]; __AngularJS__ 
is a structural framework for dynamic web applications and provides a complete client-side solution.
__ZK MVVM__ is a data binder to synchronize data between the View (__ZUL Page__) and ViewModel (__Java Object__),
in this project the View will be the __AngularJS__'s template (HTML & CSS). The following figure illustrates the whole concept of this project.
